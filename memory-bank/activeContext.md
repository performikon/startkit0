# Active Context

## Purpose

This file tracks the project's current status, including focus areas, challenges, and open questions. It provides a snapshot of the current development context without duplicating task management information.

## Update Format

Updates should be timestamped and added to the relevant section:
`[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - [Summary of Change/Focus/Issue]`

## Current Focus

- Project brief definition to establish clear boundaries and prevent feature bloat
- Establishing phase-based implementation approach with incremental development strategy
- Creating guidelines for feature sizing and implementation to avoid overengineering
- Setting technical boundaries for each service component

## Recent Changes
