# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

## Current Focus

- Project brief definition to establish clear boundaries and prevent feature bloat
- Establishing phase-based implementation approach with incremental development strategy
- Creating guidelines for feature sizing and implementation to avoid overengineering
- Setting technical boundaries for each service component

## Recent Changes

- Created Memory Bank structure
- Established initial project context documentation
- Created implementation guidelines for Supabase
- Fixed implementation issues in Supabase services

- Fixed TypeScript type errors and Supabase test failures in the Supabase package.

- Improved test coverage for Supabase services (Storage, Auth, Db) and the Error class, including tests for edge cases, error handling, and CI environment compatibility.

- Fixed issues in `SupabaseDbService.delete` (improved type checking) and `SupabaseStorageService.remove` (added try/catch) methods, leading to successful test runs.
- All 122 tests across 5 test suites are now passing successfully with no TypeScript errors.

## Open Questions/Issues

- Consider implementing unit tests for Supabase services
- Evaluate if additional error handling is needed for edge cases
