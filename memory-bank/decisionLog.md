# Decision Log

## Purpose

This file records significant architectural and implementation decisions in chronological order. Each entry includes the decision, rationale, and implementation details when applicable.

## Update Format

All entries should be timestamped and added in chronological order:
`[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - [Summary of Decision]`

## Decisions

### [2025-05-07 14:28:45] - Adopt Monorepo Architecture with Turborepo

#### Decision

- Adopt a monorepo architecture using Turborepo
- Implement a phase-based approach with strict feature sizing guidelines
- Centralize Supabase integration in a shared package (`packages/supabase`)

#### Rationale

- Monorepo architecture:
  - Streamlines dependency management across multiple applications
  - Simplifies code sharing between frontend and backend components
  - Enables coordinated versioning and consistent tooling
  - Facilitates easier testing and deployment pipelines
- Phase-based implementation with feature sizing:
  - Prevents feature creep and overengineering
  - Ensures each feature is manageable and focused
  - Provides clear boundaries for what's in/out of scope
  - Enables incremental delivery with measurable progress
  - Reduces risk of complex, monolithic implementations

#### Implementation Details

- Monorepo structure:
  - Structure separates applications (/apps) from shared resources (/packages)
  - Core API implemented as a NestJS application
  - Frontend applications using Next.js framework
  - Shared UI components and configuration packages centralized
  - TypeScript used throughout the entire codebase for type safety and developer experience
- Phase-based implementation details:
  - Phase 1 limited to core API with basic functionality
  - Features sized to be implementable in 1-2 days maximum
  - Regular review process to prevent scope expansion
  - Clear technical boundaries for each service
  - Success criteria focused on functionality, not complexity

### [2025-05-07 14:46:01] - Establish Phase-Based Implementation Approach

#### Decision

- Implement a phase-based approach to project development
- Establish clear feature sizing guidelines (1-2 days per feature)
- Define strict boundaries for each phase to prevent scope creep

#### Rationale

- Incremental development reduces risk and allows for early feedback
- Clear phase boundaries help manage expectations and prioritize work
- Feature sizing guidelines prevent overengineering and ensure steady progress

#### Implementation Details

- Phase 1 focuses on core infrastructure and basic functionality
- Each subsequent phase builds on previous work with clear deliverables
- Regular review process to evaluate progress and adjust plans as needed

### [2025-05-08 13:01:00] - Standardize Memory Bank Documentation

#### Decision

- Standardize all memory bank files with consistent formatting and structure
- Implement clear update guidelines for each file
- Eliminate duplication between files

#### Rationale

- Consistent documentation improves readability and maintainability
- Clear update guidelines ensure proper usage of each file
- Eliminating duplication reduces maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies

#### Implementation Details

- Added purpose and update format sections to each file
- Standardized timestamp format: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
- Created README.md with overall memory bank guidelines
- Reorganized content to eliminate duplication between files
