## Decision

- Adopt a monorepo architecture using Turborepo
- Implement a phase-based approach with strict feature sizing guidelines

## Decision

- Adopt a monorepo architecture using Turborepo
- Implement a phase-based approach with strict feature sizing guidelines
- Centralize Supabase integration in a shared package (`packages/supabase`)

## Rationale

- Monorepo architecture:

  - Streamlines dependency management across multiple applications
  - Simplifies code sharing between frontend and backend components
  - Enables coordinated versioning and consistent tooling
  - Facilitates easier testing and deployment pipelines

- Phase-based implementation with feature sizing:
  - Prevents feature creep and overengineering
  - Ensures each feature is manageable and focused
  - Provides clear boundaries for what's in/out of scope
  - Enables incremental delivery with measurable progress
  - Reduces risk of complex, monolithic implementations

## Implementation Details

- Monorepo structure:

  - Structure separates applications (/apps) from shared resources (/packages)
  - Core API implemented as a NestJS application
  - Frontend applications using Next.js framework
  - Shared UI components and configuration packages centralized
  - TypeScript used throughout the entire codebase for type safety and developer experience

- Phase-based implementation details:
  - Phase 1 limited to core API with basic functionality
  - Features sized to be implementable in 1-2 days maximum
  - Regular review process to prevent scope expansion
  - Clear technical boundaries for each service
  - Success criteria focused on functionality, not complexity
